Kick off your blog project with this default boilerplate (based off of

This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to
get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

- [Jason Lengstorf (@jlengstorf)](https://github.com/jlengstorf) for the
  one-on-one time at Toronto's first JAMstack meetup, having so much gatsby
  opensource available for me to learn from, all of the great support he gives
  to the Gatsby community, and just for being awesome.
